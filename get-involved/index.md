The Iowa City Game Dev Meetup is run entirely by volunteers, and we could use your help! If you're interested in helping make our group even better, there are two ways you can get involved:

1. **Join the Leadership Team.**

   The Leadership Team is a core group of people who are committed to overseeing the long-term health and maintenance of our community. This involves things such as planning, coming up with new ideas, maintaining our infrastructure (e.g., Discord server, website, etc.), and community moderation. The team meets once every other month to review progress, make decisions, and assign ownership of tasks.

2. **Organize or coordinate an event.**

   When we can, we like to have events like game jams or in-person meetups. However, these take time and effort to plan and coordinate, so extra volunteers are usually needed in order to make them happen. If there's a specific event you're interested in organizing, or if you just want to help with events in general, we'd love to hear from you! Volunteers of this type are temporarily assigned the "Event Organizer" role in Discord, which gives them the administrative permissions needed for planning, advertising, and coordinating events.

## How to Volunteer

If you're interested in volunteering, simply reach out to a member of the Leadership Team and let them know what you're interested in helping with. This can be done in Discord either by using the `@Leadership Team` mention in one of the server's channels, or by sending a direct message to someone with the "Leadership Team" role. We don't have strict requirements, so prospective volunteers will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
