      <h2>Game Dev Meetup</h2>
      <p>
        This is our main event, where we get together and converse about game development. It happens twice per
        month. It's generally pretty laid back, and we go where the conversation takes us - though we sometimes
        have presentations given by members on various topics. This is also a great time for people to show what
        they've been working on.

      <h2>Game Dev Together</h2>
      <p>
        Come hang out in our Discord server while working on your game dev project! This is a weekly event that
        allows people to get work done while enjoying the company of others. It's also a good place to ask
        questions or chat about what you're working on. No minimum amount of experience is required - we'd love to
        help you learn!
