By participating in this group, you are agreeing to abide by this code of conduct.

## Our Community Values

Diversity is a core value of our group, and we believe that by learning from those with different backgrounds and experiences, we can challenge our assumptions, expand our horizons, and become better versions of ourselves. We welcome people of all ages, genders, gender expressions, sexual orientations, religions, abilities, races, ethnicities, nationalities, physical appearances, body sizes, and experience levels who share an interest in game development.

Our aim is to foster a safe, inclusive, and supportive community for anyone interested in game development, and to empower each other in advancing our skills and projects.

## Encouraged Behaviors

- Showing respect for others.
- Being thoughtful and considerate in your interactions.
- Making people feel welcome, especially those from groups who are commonly marginalized in game development work and communities.
- Providing helpful and constructive feedback on others' work when it is sought after and welcomed.

## Prohibited Behaviors

- Showing discrimination of any kind (e.g., racism, sexism, ableism, ageism).
- Behaving in a disruptive manner (e.g., harassment, bullying, spamming, trolling).
- Advocating for or promoting belief systems, ideologies, or power structures that are inherently discriminatory, oppressive, and/or harmful to marginalized groups (e.g., white supremacy, fascism, patriarchy).
- Sharing of others' personal information or unpublished work without their consent. *(__Disclaimer:__ We cannot ensure confidentiality of information shared within the group, so please use discretion when sharing anything you consider private.)*

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this code of conduct, please report it to a member of the Leadership Team, who can be identified by the “Leadership Team” role in our Discord server. Reports can be made via direct message, or, if appropriate, within a channel in our Discord server. All reports made in a private manner will be kept confidential.

The Leadership Team has the right to decide on appropriate consequences for violations, ranging from a verbal warning to removal from the group, depending on the severity and/or repeated nature of the offense. Even harmful behaviors performed outside the group’s context can lead to consequences if they have the potential to cause distress within the group or to tarnish the group's reputation.

Whenever possible, we strive to resolve conflicts in a manner that is beneficial to all parties and results in stronger relationships in the long run. We acknowledge that no one is perfect, and we encourage growth and learning. However, we also recognize the need to consider the impact of people's actions and will take more severe measures when appropriate.
